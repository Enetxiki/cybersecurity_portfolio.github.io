# Portfolio_cybersecurity

Hi! My name is Eneritz and this is the portfolio I am completing for Google's cybersecurity course. I will be adding some 
portfolio activities I made by myself continuing the guidelines of the course.

Here is a small personal and professional statement about me:
- [Professional Statement](https://github.com/Enetxiki/Professional-statement-Ene.git)
  
From now on, we will start with a few incident reports about various topics, the first one is about a DoS attack a company suffers:
- [Incident report DoS attack](https://github.com/Enetxiki/cybersecurity_incident_report-Dos.git)
  In this one, I analyze the network traffic of a website and try to discover what's wrong with it's proper functioning:
- [Incident report network traffic analysis](https://github.com/Enetxiki/incident-report.git)
  Here I made a complete security audit about Botium Toys:
- [Botium Toys security audit](https://github.com/Enetxiki/Eneritz-security-audit-.git)
  We also have another example of a DoS attack, specifically a DDoS attack:
- [Incident report DDoS attack](https://github.com/Enetxiki/incident-report/blob/5df21a1ee58d54917720e77c963b04993e2cb97f/DDoS%20attack/done_incident%20report%20analysis%20final%20task.docx)
  At this point, we started practicing some Operating System hardening techniques:
- [OS hardening](https://github.com/Enetxiki/incident-report/blob/5df21a1ee58d54917720e77c963b04993e2cb97f/OS%20hardening/done_security%20incident%20report%20os%20hardening.docx)
  Here, I tried to make a risk assessment about an organization:
- [Risk assessment](https://github.com/Enetxiki/incident-report/blob/5df21a1ee58d54917720e77c963b04993e2cb97f/Risk%20assessment/done_security%20risk%20assessment%20template.docx)
  Starting with the module of SQL, we learned how to apply filters:
- [Applying filters to SQL](https://github.com/Enetxiki/incident-report/blob/5df21a1ee58d54917720e77c963b04993e2cb97f/Apply%20filters%20to%20SQL/done_Apply%20filters%20to%20SQL%20queries.docx)
  To close with this module, we've been using Linux and it's permissions:
- [Using permissions in Linux](https://github.com/Enetxiki/incident-report/blob/5df21a1ee58d54917720e77c963b04993e2cb97f/Permissions%20Linux/done_File%20permissions%20in%20Linux.docx)
